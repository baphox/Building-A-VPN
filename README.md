# Building-A-VPN

# Objective

The key objective of building a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is to establish a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, typically the internet. Here are the main objectives and purposes of implementing a VPN:
-Secure Data Transmission
-Remote Access
-Privacy Protection
-Bypassing Geographical Restrictions
-Enhanced Security for Public Wi-Fi
-Protection Against Surveillance and Censorship
-Secure Communication between Networks

# System Requirements:

  Server Hardware:
        CPU: OpenVPN does not require high CPU resources unless you're dealing with a very high number of concurrent connections or heavy encryption.
        RAM: The amount of RAM depends on the number of concurrent VPN connections and the workload. Generally, 512MB to 1GB of RAM is sufficient for small to medium-sized deployments.
        Storage: OpenVPN itself doesn't consume much storage space, but ensure you have enough disk space to store configuration files, logs, and any additional data.

  Network Interface Cards (NIC):
        Gigabit Ethernet adapters are recommended for high-speed VPN connections.
        For optimal performance, ensure that your server hardware supports the required network throughput.

  Firewall/Router:
        Ensure that your firewall/router supports VPN passthrough and can forward VPN traffic to the OpenVPN server.

# Software Requirements:

Operating System:

  OpenVPN supports various operating systems including Linux, Windows, macOS, and FreeBSD.
  Choose a stable and supported operating system for your OpenVPN server. Popular choices include Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Windows Server.

OpenVPN Software:

  Install the OpenVPN software package appropriate for your server's operating system.
  You can download the OpenVPN software from the official OpenVPN website or use package managers available for your operating system.
